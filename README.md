# Graph Curvature / Network Curvature / Ollivier Ricci Curvature

Compute Ollivier Ricci curvature (e.g., Graph Curvature, Network Curvature)
    on a NetworkX graph object, described in
    `Ricci curvature of Markov chains on metric spaces, Yann Ollivier
    <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002212360800493X?via%3Dihub>`

    This method has been used in numerous studies for estimating patient prognosis
    from "omics" data. Examples:
